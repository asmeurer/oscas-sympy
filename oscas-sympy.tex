SymPy is also used in other mathematics software systems.
For example, SfePy (\url{http://sfepy.org/})
includes SymPy. SfePy is a software for solving systems of coupled partial differential 
equations (PDEs) by the finite element method in 2D and 3D.
The software Sage (\url{http://www.sagemath.org/}) also includes SymPy.

SymPy's latest release (as of October 2011) is 0.7.1.

\section{SymPy's history and language}

\begin{quotation}
Some people say, that GPL had its place in history. Well, maybe
it had, maybe not, it's hard to say - let's leave it for historians.
But today in 2011,  I think that there is no advantage of GPL over
BSD. The only thing that matters is to have a solid
community, so that lots of people contribute to the project. Also it
seems that these days, there are a lot of people who come to
open-source, who don't really feel strongly about licensing, they just
want their code to be used (no matter how), and thus use BSD. 

{\em - \OC}
\end{quotation}

\subsection{History}

SymPy was started by \OC in 2005 while a
physics undergraduate at the Charles University in Prague.
He wrote initial code during the
summer, then he improved it during the summer 2006, but otherwise the project
stalled until February 2007, when
Fabian Pedregosa joined the project and helped fixed many things, contributed
documentation and made it alive again. The development hasn't stopped since
then.

Many students improved SymPy incredibly 
as part of the Google Summer of Code (GSoC):
\begin{itemize}
\item
GSoC2007: Mateusz Paprocki, Brian
Jorgensen, Jason Gedge, Robert Schwarz and Chris Wu,
\item
GSoC2008: Fredrik Johansson,

\item
GSoC2009: Priit Laes, Freddie Witherden, Aaron Meurer,
Fabian Pedregosa, Dale Peterson,

\item
GSoC2010:
Addison Cugini, Christian Muise, Aaron Meurer, Matthew Curry,
{\O}yvind Jensen,

\item
GSoC2011: Tom Bachmann, Gilbert Gede, Tomo Lazovich, Saptarshi Mandal, 
Sherjil Ozair, Vladimir Peri\'c,  Matthew Rocklin, Sean Vig, Jeremias Yehdegho.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
SymPy is a team project and it was developed by a lot of people, not
just GSoC students. For example in the early stages, Pearu Peterson
joined the development during the summer 2007 and he has made SymPy much more
competitive by rewriting the core from scratch, that has made it from 10x to
100x faster. The git repository at [1] contains all patches since July 19, 2007
and as of this writing (October 2011) it contains patches from around 141
different people (using {\tt git shortlog -ns | wc -l}).

On Jan 4, 2011 \OC passed the project leadership to Aaron Meurer.


\subsection{Active developers}

SymPy is a project with an active community of
over 100 developers contributing to it. However, among the most active (on the
mailinglist, patches, reviews, management) as of this writing (October 2011)
are Aaron Meurer, \OC, Brian Granger, Matuesz Paprocki, Ronan Lamy, and Chris
Smith. Good (but not perfect) indicator is the number of patches contributed by
people in the last year, for example the top 10 are:

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize,fontfamily=courier,fontshape=tt,frame=single,label=git-log]

$ git shortlog -ns --since="1 year ago" | head -n 10
   590  Chris Smith
   579  Mateusz Paprocki
   413  Aaron Meurer
   172  Ronan Lamy
   149  Saptarshi Mandal
    91  Gilbert Gede
    90  Vladimir Perić
    89  Brian Granger
    79  Matthew Rocklin
    74  Ondřej Čertík
\end{Verbatim}


\subsection{Language}

\begin{quotation}
To me, there are three main
advantages of SymPy.  First, is that it is very portable,
since it is written in pure Python with no dependencies.
Second is that it is built on top of a very strong and easy to use
language, Python, which is a huge improvement over every other
computer algebra system, especially the ones that have invented their
own language.  Third, since it's just a Python module, it can very
easily be used as a library. 

{\em - Aaron Meurer}
\end{quotation}

There are even versions of SymPy for smartphones!
In addition, besides the fact that it is free, one of the best advantages 
to SymPy is how {\it easy} it is to install.
From a teacher's perspective, this is important. 

SymPy runs inside a normal Python interpreter, such as the one that
comes with your system's Python or IPython.
It is started by executing the Python script {\tt isympy}
found within SymPy's bin subdirectory.
This starts a normal Python shell (IPython shell if you have the
IPython package installed),  that (pre)executes the following commands:

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize,fontfamily=courier,fontshape=tt,frame=single,label=Python]

>>> from __future__ import division
>>> from sympy import *
>>> x, y, z, t = symbols('x y z t')
>>> k, m, n = symbols('k m n', integer=True)
>>> f, g, h = symbols('f g h', cls=Function)

\end{Verbatim}
So starting {\tt isympy} is equivalent to starting Python (or IPython)
and executing the above commands by hand. 
For example, the following simple Python commands were run 
from the command line after starting {\tt isympy}.

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize,fontfamily=courier,fontshape=tt,frame=single,label=SymPy]

>>> L = [i^2 for i in range(10) if i%2==0]
>>> L; len(L)
[2, 0, 6, 4, 10]
5

\end{Verbatim}

The following example was taken from Mateusz Paprocki's master's
degree thesis \cite{P}.

\begin{example}
{\rm
Suppose we are in possession of American coins: pennies, nickels,
dimes and quarters. We would like to compose a certain quantity out of
those coins, say 117, such that the number of coins used is
minimal. Let's forget about the minimality criterion for a moment. In
this scenario it is not a big problem to compose the requested
value. We can simply take 117 pennies and we are done, as long as we
have so many of them. Alternatively we can take 10 dimes, 3 nickels
and 2 pennies, or 2 quarters, 3 dimes, 5 nickels and 12 pennies,
etc. There are quite a few combinations that can be generated to get
the desired value. But which of those combinations leads to the
minimal number of necessary coins? To answer this question we will
take advantage of Gr\"obner bases computed with respect to a total
degree ordering of monomials.

Our problem is a minimisation problem, so we take advantage of total
degree ordering. 
This is a correct choice because total degree ordering takes monomials
with smaller sums 
of exponents first and we can observe that the smaller the sum of
exponents in a solution 
to our coins problem will be, the less coins will be needed. So, the
chosen ordering of 
monomials encodes the cost function of our problem.

How to get the minimal number of required coins? Suppose we take any
admissible solution 
to the studied problem. This can be the trivial solution in which we
take 117 pennies or any 
other such that the total value of coins is equal to 117. We encode
the chosen solution as a 
binomial with numbers of particular coins as exponents of $p, n, d$ and
$q$, and we reduce this 
binomial with respect to the Gr\"obner basis G utilizing
graded lexicographic ordering of monomials.


\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize,fontfamily=courier,fontshape=tt,frame=single,label=SymPy]

>>> var('p, n, d, q')
(p, n, d, q)
>>> F = [p**5 - n, p**10 - d, p**25 - q]
>>> G = groebner(F, order='grlex')
>>> reduced(p**117, G, order='grlex')[1]
     2  4
d n p  q

\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
The answer, that we were able to compute with SymPy, is 1
dime, 1 nickel, 2 pennies, and 4 quarters.
which altogether give the requested value of 117. This is also the minimal solution to our problem.

\subsection{Capabilities}

Currently, SymPy core has extensive computational capabilities including:

\begin{itemize}
\item
    basic arithmetics $*,/,+,-,**$,
\item
    basic simplification (like $a*b*b + 2*b*a*b \mapsto 3*a*b^2$),
\item
    expansion (like $(a+b)^2 \mapsto a^2 + 2*a*b + b^2$),
\item
    functions ($\exp, \ln$, \dots),
\item
    complex numbers (like $\exp$(I*x).expand(complex=True) $\mapsto$
    $\cos(x)+I*\sin(x)$),
\item
    differentiation,
\item
    taylor (laurent) series,
\item
    substitution (like $x \mapsto \ln(x)$, or $\sin \mapsto \cos$),
\item
    arbitrary precision integers, rationals and floats,
\item
    noncommutative symbols,
\item
    pattern matching .
\end{itemize}
Then there are many SymPy modules, such as (for example) for these tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item
    more functions ($\sin, \cos, \tan$, atan, asin, acos, factorial, zeta, legendre),
\item
    limits (like limit($x*\log(x), x, 0) \to 0$),
\item
    integration using extended Risch-Norman heuristic,
\item
    polynomials (division, gcd, square free decomposition, groebner bases, factorization),
\item
    solvers (algebraic, difference and differential equations, and systems of equations),
\item
    symbolic matrices (determinants, LU decomposition...),
\item
  Pauli and Dirac algebra,
\item
    geometry module,
\item
    plotting (2D and 3D) .
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Quantum physics}

Thanks mostly to work done by physicist Brian Granger and students
he has directed, SymPy has a lot of functionality in quantum physics
implemented. I quote (by permission) from an email he sent to the author:

\begin{quotation}
Many problems in quantum mechanics require extensive symbolic
manipulations.  These manipulations use the various mathematical
entities of quantum mechanics:  hilbert spaces, operators,
inner/outer/tensor products, commutators/anticommutators, states,
and so on.  To make these symbolic manipulations possibly in SymPy, we have
implemented these entities in a completely general and abstract
manner.  By using subclassing, we can treat particular quantum
mechanical systems.

The most important work we have done on this front is to create
classes for simulating quantum computers and other quantum information
problems.  We are now using that framework to build optimization
algorithms for quantum computers.  Being able to handle everything
symbolically is massively important for us, as the alternative
requires constructing and multiplying extremely large matrices.

It turns out that the object-oriented nature of SymPy/Python has been
really powerful for us and is a very nice way of abstracting a general
theory (using base classes) and particular realizations of that theory in
physical systems (using subclasses).

We have also implemented a number of other physical systems as well,
but none as significant as the quantum computing stuff.

{\em - Brian Granger}
\end{quotation}

For example, here is how to convert between spin bases:

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize,fontfamily=courier,fontshape=tt,frame=single,label=SymPy]

>>> from sympy import S, latex
>>> from sympy.physics.quantum.spin import JxKet
>>> latex(JxKet(S(1)/2,S(1)/2).rewrite('Jz'))
\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2} {\left|\frac{1}{2},- \frac{1}{2}\right\rangle } + \frac{1
}{2} \sqrt{2} {\left|\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right\rangle }
>>> latex(JxKet(1,1).rewrite('Jz'))
\frac{1}{2} {\left|1,-1\right\rangle } + \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2} {\left|1,0\right
\rangle } + \frac{1}{2} {\left|1,1\right\rangle }

\end{Verbatim}
prints:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2} {\left|\frac{1}{2},- \frac{1}{2}\right\rangle } + \frac{1
}{2} \sqrt{2} {\left|\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right\rangle }
\]

\[
\frac{1}{2} {\left|1,-1\right\rangle } + \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{2} {\left|1,0\right
\rangle } + \frac{1}{2} {\left|1,1\right\rangle }
\]

For further details, see for example the papers by Cugini \cite{Cug}
and Curry \cite{Cur}, or blog posts on quantum mechanics on 
Planet SymPy (\url{http://planet.sympy.org/}).

\subsubsection{Packages}

To plot a function in SymPy you need to install a separate plotting
package, such as matplotlib or pyglet.
To install them into your local Python install, follow the
instructions on their website (that is,
\url{http://www.pyglet.org/} or
\url{http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/}).

\subsubsection{Examples}

This section merely presents a few examples to illustrate some of 
SymPy's functionality.

To plot a function in 2d, such as $y=\sin(x)$,
use the following SymPy commands.

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize,fontfamily=courier,fontshape=tt,frame=single,label=SymPy]

>>> x = Symbol("x")
>>> Plot(sin(x), [x, -3, 3])
[0]: sin(x), 'mode=cartesian'

\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
A separate window will pop-up with your (color) plot in it.
See Figure \ref{fig:sympy-plots}.

To plot a surface in 3d, such as $z=xy^3-yx^3$,
use the following SymPy commands.

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize,fontfamily=courier,fontshape=tt,frame=single,label=SymPy]

>>> var('x y z')
>>> Plot(x*y**3-y*x**3)

\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
A separate window will pop-up with your (color) plot in it.
See Figure \ref{fig:sympy-plots}.


\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\caption{2D and 3D plots using SymPy}
\label{fig:sympy-plots}
\end{figure}

SymPy has good functionality with linear algebra.
The method {\tt rref} returns the row-reduced echelon form of a matrix,
as well as a list of the pivot columns.

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize,fontfamily=courier,fontshape=tt,frame=single,label=SymPy]

>>> M = Matrix(3,3,lambda i,j: i+j)
>>> print M
[0, 1, 2]
[1, 2, 3]
[2, 3, 4]
>>> print M.rref()
([1, 0, -1]
[0, 1,  2]
[0, 0,  0], [0, 1])

\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
Indeed, there is a pivot in the first two columns but not the
third, so SymPy returns only $[0,1]$, as it should.

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize,fontfamily=courier,fontshape=tt,frame=single,label=SymPy]

>>> M = Matrix([[1,1,2],[1,2,1],[2,1,1]])
>>> print M
[1, 1, 2]
[1, 2, 1]
[2, 1, 1]
>>> print M.eigenvals()
{1: 1, -1: 1, 4: 1}
>>> print M.eigenvects()
[(1, 1, [[ 1]
[-2]
[ 1]]), (-1, 1, [[-1]
[ 0]
[ 1]]), (4, 1, [[1]
[1]
[1]])]
>>> print M.charpoly(x)
Poly(x**3 - 4*x**2 - x + 4, x, domain='ZZ')

>>> lam = M.eigenvals()
>>> lam.keys()                
[1, -1, 4]
>>> lamb = lam.keys()
>>> expand((x-lamb[0])*(x-lamb[1])*(x-lamb[2]))
 3      2        
x  - 4*x  - x + 4

\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
In the last command, we merely verify that the characteristic
polynomial is indeed a polynomial whose roots are the eigenvalues.

Thanks mostly to the work of Aaron Meurer, 
SymPy can solve higher order linear ordinary differential equations.
See Meuer \cite{M} for details of the implementation.
To solve the $3$-rd order constant coefficient ordinary differential
equation,

\[
y'''-3y''+3y'-y=10e^x,
\]
use the following SymPy commands.

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize,fontfamily=courier,fontshape=tt,frame=single,label=SymPy]

>>> x = Symbol("x")
>>> y = Function('y')
>>> de = y(x).diff(x,3)-3*y(x).diff(x,2)+3*y(x).diff(x)-y(x)-6*exp(x)
>>> soln = dsolve(de, y(x))
>>> print soln
y(x) == (C1 + C2*x + C3*x**2 + x**3)*exp(x)

\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
Surprisingly, it seems Maxima cannot do this at the present time.

SymPy handles easily a wide range of calculus computations, as the following 
commands illustrate.

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize,fontfamily=courier,fontshape=tt,frame=single,label=SymPy]

>>> print legendre(8, x).diff(x)
6435*x**7/16 - 9009*x**5/16 + 3465*x**3/16 - 315*x/16
>>> print integrate(legendre(8, x),x)
715*x**9/128 - 429*x**7/32 + 693*x**5/64 - 105*x**3/32 + 35*x/128
>>> j0 = lambda x: besselj(0,x)
>>> limit(j0(x),x,0)
besselj(0, 0)
>>> N(limit(j0(x),x,0))
1.00000000000000

\end{Verbatim}

SymPy handles Taylor series expansions with no problem.

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize,fontfamily=courier,fontshape=tt,frame=single,label=SymPy]

>>> x = Symbol('x')
>>> f = 1/cos(x)
>>> print f.series(x, 0, 10)
1 + x**2/2 + 5*x**4/24 + 61*x**6/720 + 277*x**8/8064 + O(x**10)

\end{Verbatim}

Did you know SymPy can solve a linear recurrence sequence?
For example, consider

\[
 u_{n+2} = 2  u_{n+1} + 8  u_{n}, 
\]
where we know $u_{0} = 2$ and $u_{1} = 7$.

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize,fontfamily=courier,fontshape=tt,frame=single,label=SymPy]

>>> n = Symbol('n', integer=True)
>>> u = Function('u')
>>> f=u(n+2)-2*u(n+1)-8*u(n)
>>> print rsolve(f, u(n), {u(0):2, u(1):7})
(-2)**n/6 + 11*4**n/6

\end{Verbatim}

SymPy contains wide range of special functions and it can easily be used to
evaluate complicated expressions. For example here is how to evaluate the
formula for the third order perturbative correction to the
magnetic moment of an electron in quantum electrodynamics (this example also
shows how to sum an infinite series), you can compare the formula and the value
with the abstract of the paper \cite{QED} and see that it agrees:

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize,fontfamily=courier,fontshape=tt,frame=single,label=SymPy]

>>> from sympy import pi, zeta, S, log, summation, var, oo
>>> var("n")
n
>>> a4 = summation(1/(2**n * n**4), (n, 1, oo))
>>> A_3 = 83*pi**2*zeta(3)/72 - 215*zeta(5)/24 + 100*(a4 + log(2)**4/24 - \
...         pi**2*log(2)**2/24)/3 - \
...         239*pi**4/2160 + 139*zeta(3)/18 - 298 * pi**2 * log(2)/9 + \
...         17101 * pi**2 / 810 + S(28259)/5184
>>> A_3.n()
1.18124145658720

\end{Verbatim}

In short, if you need to use a free mathematics program in teaching or
research, and one which is easily installed on various platforms,
SymPy is a great place to start. If you get stuck, there is plenty of
information
on-line, or you can join the SymPy googlegroups and
email your question to {\tt sympy@googlegroups.com}.

email from Brian Granger 2011-10-31:

Many problems in quantum mechanics require extensive symbolic
manipulations.  These manipulations use the various mathematical
entities of quantum mechanics:  hilbert spaces, operators,
inner/outer/tensor products, commutators/anticommutators, states,
and so on.  To make these symbolic manipulations possibly in SymPy, we have
implemented these entities in a completely general and abstract
manner.  By using subclassing, we can treat particular quantum
mechanical systems.

The most important work we have done on this front is to create
classes for simulating quantum computers and other quantum information
problems.  We are now using that framework to build optimization
algorithms for quantum computers.  Being able to handle everything
symbolically is massively important for us, as the alternative
requires constructing and multiplying extremely large matrices.

It turns out that the object-oriented nature of SymPy/Python has been
really powerful for us and is a very nice way of abstracting a general
theory (using base classes) and particular realizations of that theory in
physical systems (using subclasses).

We have also implemented a number of other physical systems as well,
but none as significant as the quantum computing stuff.
